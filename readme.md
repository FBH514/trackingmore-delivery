# Delivery Status Notifications
## Installation
>### Programming Language
>If Python 3 isn't installed on your machine, you can find it **[here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**.  

> ### Dependencies
>#### Option A – Bash
>- Run `install.sh`
>#### Option B – Manual Installation of Dependencies
>- Requests – find PyPi package **[here](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)**. Requests allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily. There’s no need to manually add query strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your PUT & POST data — but nowadays, just use the json method!  
 
## How It Works
>### What does the script do?
>The script uses TrackingMore **[API](https://www.trackingmore.com/api-index.html#api-version)** to get the status of the package. You need to register an account for an API key for a 7 day trial unless you want to subscribe. The API key is then used to get the last update. This is a script made for the **command line interface**. 

>### What is TrackingMore? 
> **[Trackingmore](https://www.trackingmore.com)** is a cloud-based eCommerce shipment tracking tool designed to help businesses monitor the status of orders using custom web pages, automated notifications, and more.
